title: How to Contribute
---

We want contributing to Gatsby to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone.

### Not sure how to start contributing?

If you are worried or don't know where to start, be sure to check out our [where to participate](/contributing/where-to-participate/) page. You can also reach out to [Marcy Sutton (@marcysutton) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcysutton) or submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!

### Creating your own plugins and loaders

If you create a loader or plugin, we would love for you to open source it and put it on npm. For more information on creating custom plugins, please see the documentation for [plugins](/docs/plugins/) and the [API specification](/docs/api-specification/).
